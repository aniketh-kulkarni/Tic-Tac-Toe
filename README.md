Tic-Tac-Toe Game Documentation

Overview:

This project involves the development of a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game using Python. The game allows a user to play against the computer, with the computer making random moves. The project showcases proficiency in Python, modular code design, and adherence to coding standards.

Key Features:

1. Board Representation:
   - The game board is represented using a three-element list, with each element being another three-element list, simulating a 3x3 grid.
   - Each cell in the grid can contain 'O', 'X', or a digit representing the square's number.

2. User Interaction:
   - The user interacts with the game by entering the number of the square they choose.
   - User input is validated to ensure it is an integer between 1 and 9, and the chosen square is not already occupied.

3. Computer Moves:
   - The computer's first move is strategically placed in the middle of the board ('X').
   - Subsequent computer moves are random, utilizing the `random` module to choose an unoccupied square.

4. Winning and Tie Conditions:
   - The game checks for a winner by examining rows, columns, and diagonals for a complete sequence of 'O's or 'X's.
   - A tie is declared if the board is full and no winner is determined.

5. Code Structure:
   - The code is organized into functions for better modularity.
   - Functions include printing the board, checking for a winner, determining a tie, obtaining valid user moves, and executing computer moves.

6. User Experience:
   - Clear prompts and informative error messages enhance the user experience.
   - The game state is consistently displayed after each move, providing feedback to the user.

Implementation Details:

- Programming Language: Python
- Randomization: Utilized the `random` module for computer moves.
- Data Structures: Employed nested lists to represent the game board.
- Functions: Modularized code with functions for different aspects of the game.
- User Input Handling: Validated user input to ensure adherence to game rules.

Coding Standards:

- Adhered to PEP 8 style guidelines for Python, maintaining clean and readable code.
- Included comments for key sections to enhance code readability.

Conclusion:

This Tic-Tac-Toe project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, problem-solving skills, and the ability to create an interactive and enjoyable game. The implementation adheres to coding standards, emphasizing clean and modular code design.
